# Hospital-Readmission-Analysis-in-R

The purpose of this project is for me to get familiar with R by:
1. Importing and cleaning a dataset
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Plotting
   
I used this dataset that I found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dubradave/hospital-readmissions/data

I have attached a report on my findings from the dataset in this repository that summarizes how I tried to determine the causes and factors affecting hospital readmission rates and what I found from my analysis of the data.
